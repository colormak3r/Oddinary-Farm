# Oddinary Farm

## Overview

Oddinary Farm is a not-so-ordinary multiplayer arcade video game focusing on farming. The game focused on three core elements:

* Arcade Farming Gameplay: Unlike typical slow-paced, relaxing farming games, Oddinary Farm introduces an exciting, fast-paced world centered around building and managing a farm.
* Procedural Generation: Each playthrough offers a new experience, as no two playthroughs are alike. However, the game is designed to reward players who recognize patterns in the environment and game mechanics.
* Co-op Multiplayer: Players can choose to team up with others to grow and manage their farm, making cooperation an optional but engaging feature.
